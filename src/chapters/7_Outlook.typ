= Outlook
In cloud-native environments monitoring ecosystems will remain essential for effectiveness. Tools are converting toward telemetry pipelines with OpenTelemetry collectors. Native support for telemetry correlation will improve the feedback loop between incident diagnosis and capacity planning. TSDB engines continiue to improve towards a columnar storage, better retention and improved efficiency. Cardinality management will remain central for scaling applications: label-organization, aggragation and processing strategies will be embedded earlier in collection pipelines to further improve performance.
